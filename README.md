## üéì Project Context & Motivation

This repository documents my learning journey and practical exercises undertaken by **Fahim Kamal Ahmed** as part of **Course 4: Blueprint Scripting**. This course is a component of the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera.

The primary goal of this Unreal Engine project is to diligently apply the concepts taught in the "Blueprint Scripting" course. This involves practicing the creation of various gameplay mechanics and systems, thereby building a tangible portfolio of Blueprinting examples and deepening my understanding of Unreal Engine's visual scripting capabilities.

---

## üéØ Overview

This Unreal Engine **5.5.1** project serves as a dedicated, hands-on workspace for exploring, implementing, and mastering **Blueprint visual scripting**. It will contain a progressively growing collection of scenes, Actors, components, and gameplay systems developed following the curriculum of the Epic Games Blueprint Scripting course.

This repository will showcase:
*   Implementations of course-specific exercises and challenges.
*   Experimentation with diverse Blueprint nodes, logic flows, and communication patterns.
*   Small, focused prototypes demonstrating core gameplay mechanics (e.g., interactive objects, character abilities, UI elements, data management, etc., as covered throughout the course modules).

## üìö Modules & Learning Log (Work in Progress)

This section will be updated incrementally as I, Fahim Kamal Ahmed, progress through the course modules and complete the associated exercises and projects. Detailed descriptions and key learnings for specific tasks will be added upon their completion and integration into this repository.

## ‚ú® Key Learning Objectives (Guiding This Project)

This project aims to solidify my understanding and practical application of:
*   The foundational principles of Blueprint visual scripting and its synergy with C++ in Unreal Engine.
*   Core programming constructs within Blueprints: variables, data types, functions, macros, flow control (branches, loops), and event handling.
*   Designing and implementing interactive game elements and dynamic environmental features.
*   Effective Blueprint communication strategies: direct communication, casting, interfaces, and event dispatchers.
*   Developing player characters, controllers, camera systems, and responsive input configurations using the Enhanced Input system.
*   Creating user interfaces (UI) and heads-up displays (HUD) with Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG).
*   Managing game data using Data Assets and other appropriate structures.
*   Employing debugging techniques and best practices for testing and refining Blueprint logic.
*   Approaching game development tasks with a prototyping mindset, leveraging Blueprints for rapid iteration.

## üîÆ Future Plans (Beyond Course Completion)

*(This section will be populated with ideas as the course progresses or upon its completion. Potential avenues include expanding course projects into more robust portfolio pieces or exploring personal game concepts using the skills acquired.)*

*   Example: Deep-dive into more advanced Blueprint optimization techniques.
*   Example: Combine several learned mechanics into a cohesive mini-game or unique interactive experience.
*   Example: Explore the integration of Blueprints with C++ for more complex systems.
